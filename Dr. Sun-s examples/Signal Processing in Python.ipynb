The lowest frequency in this signal is called the fundamental frequency (in the case of C4, 261 Hz). The other frequencies are called the harmonics and are integer multiples of the fundamental frequencies (in the case of C4, the harmonics are at 522 Hz, 783 Hz, 1044 Hz, and so on). The harmonics blend so well with the fundamental that the human ear just perceives one note. However, the harmonics shape the character of the sound and are the main difference a violin sounds different from a trumpet playing the same note.\n",
